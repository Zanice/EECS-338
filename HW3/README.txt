    [Findings]

        The above outputs are shown completely unmodified. From one process to
        two, the total time of each decreased. From two processes to three,
        it stayed about the same. Thereafter, however, the total time increased
        with every additional process. I expected the opposite behavior: that
        the total time would decrease with additional processes, but this
        is not what I observed.
